The project aims to address the issue of hospital readmissions, which can have significant impacts on both healthcare resources and patient well-being. When a patient is 
readmitted to the hospital shortly after being discharged, it can result in additional costs, strain on resources, and potential complications for the patient.

In our project, we implemented a diverse array of machine-learning techniques to address the complexity of our problem. This approach involved leveraging the strengths and 
capabilities of various algorithms to ensure a comprehensive exploration of potential solutions. By incorporating techniques such as neural networks,K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
and logistic regression, we adopted a well-rounded strategy that allowed us to tackle different aspects of the problem with precision and adaptability.
This diverse approach not only enriched our understanding of the data but also provided us with the flexibility to select the most suitable models for specific tasks within the 
project. Overall, our employment of different machine learning techniques underscores our commitment to a thorough and thoughtful methodology, 
aiming to achieve the most accurate and effective results possible.
